# Thank You

Thank you for choosing my project. You are helping in making the project bigger.

Follow the golden rule:

> Code, Document, Raise Issues and Review as if you have to explain everything
> to a new developer without saying a word.

## First Time

The first thing to do always is to run the program and note how it works. One of
the best ways to do this is to launch the application and go through the files
that it launches in the sequential manner.

Also make note of the coding style and dependencies that the project follows.

## Choosing issues

It is recommended to go through the issues tab after you have run the program
once and look for easy issues.

If an issue is not assigned; follow through the comments, ask queries about it
and then start working on it.

# Opening an issue

If you find a bug in the code or a problem while running the code, please open
an issue and provide some details like how to reproduce it. If you feel some
feature is missing or the documentation lacks in some way, feel free to open an
issue in this case too. If you are able to solve the issue, sending a pull
request is highly appreciated.

## Sending a PR

While sending a PR, always remember not to send one from your master branch; it
will lead to future conflicts when your PR is merged into this repository's
master. This can be avoided by sending PRs from a feature branch.

It is highly recommended to follow the below guidelines while writing commits
and sending PRs:

- [Writing a good pull request][1] ([Archive][2])
- [Writing good commit messages][3] ([Archive][4])
